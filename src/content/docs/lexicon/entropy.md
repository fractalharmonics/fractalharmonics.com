title: Entropy
---

Entropy is the tendency of organized patterns to lose internal alignment over time, drifting toward disorder. In field terms, entropy describes the weakening of coherent relationship: movements become less coordinated, signals become less legible, and structure becomes harder to sustain. Entropy is not evil or failure; it is a natural directionality that appears wherever coherence is not continuously maintained.
