title: Zero Point
---

Zero point is the stillness found at the fulcrum of polar activity. It is not absence, void, or pre-creation. In structural terms, emanation begins at the zero point, cohesion crosses the zero point, and integration returns toward the zero point. Zero point functions as an invariant balance that stabilizes polarity without halting motion.
