title: Mode

A mode is the manner in which a pattern expresses itself within a given context. While a domain names where a process is operating, mode names how it is operating—the characteristic way coherence, polarity, and organization are carried through change. Modes do not alter the underlying structure of the process; they describe its style of expression.
