title: Entrainment
---

Entrainment is the process by which patterns of activity synchronize through interaction. When a coherent rhythm is present, nearby movement tends to adjust toward it, gradually aligning timing and relationship. Entrainment is not coercion; it is a relational convergence that becomes more likely as coherence, proximity, and repeated interaction increase.
