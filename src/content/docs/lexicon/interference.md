Interference is the result of patterns of activity meeting and combining. When two or more movements overlap, their relationship produces a new pattern—sometimes reinforcing, sometimes canceling, often generating variation. Interference is not inherently disruptive; it is a basic mechanism by which complexity and difference emerge within an ongoing field.
