title: Domain

A domain is a bounded context in which a pattern operates and can be described. Domains distinguish where a process is expressed—such as physiological, relational, ecological, or experiential—without changing the underlying structure of the process itself. Domains are not separate realities; they are different contexts in which the same formative movement can appear.
