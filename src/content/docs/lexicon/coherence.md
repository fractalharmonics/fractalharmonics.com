title: Coherence
---

Coherence is the degree to which a pattern of activity holds stable relationship within itself. A coherent field maintains internal alignment across its movements, so that change occurs without collapsing the integrity of the whole. Coherence is not sameness and does not require stillness; it is ordered relationship sustained through motion.
