title: Field Effect
---

A field effect is the influence a coherent pattern exerts on what enters its range. This influence occurs through relationship rather than force: nearby activity tends to shift in response to the field’s existing organization. Field effects can stabilize, organize, or destabilize local movement depending on compatibility, proximity, and strength of coherence.
